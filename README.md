This is a Ruby on Rails application that was created in 
RubyMine 2018.3.5 x64.

It was created using Ruby version 2.3.3p222 and Rails
version 5.1.6.2.

It includes Ruby, Ruby on Rails, CSS, SCSS, HTML.ERB, JavaScript and sqlite3 files.

To run the application in RubyMine, complete the following after opening the 
project in RubyMine:

1. Type "rails server -p3000" in the terminal.

2. Wait until the terminal runs and ends with "Use Ctrl-C to stop".

3. Open a web browser (I use Chrome) and type in the address 
http://localhost:3000/movies.

4. The application itself should be self-explanatory.  Click on 
"Learn More" at any place to select a movie or an actor, and learn
more about the movie and/or actor.  To return to the Movie menu, 
click "Movies" on the menu at the top.  To return to the Actor menu, 
click "Actors" at the top.
